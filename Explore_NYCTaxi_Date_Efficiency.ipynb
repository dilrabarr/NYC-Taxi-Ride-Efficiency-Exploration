    "The metric I propose is **Weighted Proportion of Efficient Rides** among total rides. Details on **Weight** and **Efficient Rides** are provided in the following section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an algorithm to tell us whether a ride is **efficient or not** (this algorithm will be discussed in the following steps). Also suppose that we have a **weight** for each ride (this weight will be discussed in the following steps). Using this information, we can get the overall efficiency of many rides using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$efficiency=\\frac{\\text{sum of weights for all efficient rides}}{\\text{sum of weights for all rides}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets discuss the algorithm to judge whether a ride is **efficient or not**. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe, when it comes to the efficiency of a ride, there are the following two factors that matter: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of people in that ride** <br>\n",
    "For example, when two cars are travelling from place A to place B, if both of them are carrying only one passenger, then one of the two cars are having **inefficient ride** because we could potentially use just one car for two passengers (assuming car can carry up to 5 people).<br> \n",
    "However, if both of those cars are carrying 4 passengers, then both of the cars are having **efficient ride** because there is no way we can fit 8 passengers in one car.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direction of the ride (distance, time)**<br>\n",
    "For example, there are two cars (car1 and car2) and both of them are carrying only one passenger. Lets assume car1 is travelling from place A to place B, car2 is travelling from place A to place C. If place B and place C are very close and it will only take very small amount of extra time for one car to drop off the passenger at place B and then drop off another passenger at place C, then we can argue that one of the cars is having **inefficient ride**. <br>\n",
    "However, if place B and place C are very far and it takes a lot of extra time for one car to drop off one passenger at place B and then drop off another passenger at place C, then we can argue that both of the rides are having **efficient ride**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above discussion, I propose the following algorithm for judging whether each ride is **efficient or not** for a set of rides that have close pick up times (pick up times are within 5 minutes interval. We have to batch process here because pick up times of the rides should be very close for us to combine them ): \n",
    "\n",
    "**For** each ride **do**:<br> \n",

    "\n",
    "How do we decide if we can merge two rides? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule to merge two rides: \n",
    "-  Car should be able to carry the passengers of two cars\n",
    "- the extra time spent on the new route should be less than 10 minutes (this is a parameter of the algorithm we can change later)\n",
    "- the extra distance travelled should be less than 5 miles (this is a paramater of the algorithm we can change later)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets assume there are 10 rides. To judge wether a ride is efficient or not, we compare current ride with all other 9 rides and see if it is possible to combine current ride with any of those 9 rides on the condition that the other car can fit the passengers of two cars, the **extra distance** with the new route will be less than 5 miles and **extra trip time** with the new route will be less than 10 minutes.

For example, there are two rides, both of them are inefficient based on our algorithm discussed above. However, if one of the rides has a very long trip distance, our metric should be able to reflect the fact that this ride is more inefficient than the other ride with shorter trip distance. \n",
